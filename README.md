MERN Todo Application

The MERN Todo Application is a clean and simple task-management tool built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This project allows users to add new todos, view their list of tasks, and delete items when completed. It is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to use, showcasing how a full-stack application works end-to-end using modern JavaScript technologies.

This project demonstrates core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can enter a todo item, save it to the backend through an API call, and immediately see it displayed in the UI. Todos are stored in MongoDB, making them persistent across sessions. The backend is built with Node.js and Express and exposes REST API endpoints, while the frontend is built using React and communicates with the backend through Axios or Fetch. The app also maintains a clean and responsive design to ensure smooth usage on both desktop and mobile devices.

The technology stack used in this project includes React.js for the user interface, Node.js and Express for server-side logic, and MongoDB as the database. The frontend is deployed on Vercel for fast global hosting and automatic builds, while the backend can be deployed on platforms like Render or any Node.js-friendly hosting service.

The project is structured into two main folders: a backend folder that contains all server files (routes, controllers, models, configuration, and server setup) and a frontend folder that includes all React components, pages, and styles. The separation makes the app easy to maintain and helps beginners understand how frontend and backend work together in a MERN application.

To run the application locally, the backend server needs to be set up by installing dependencies, connecting MongoDB using a connection string, and running the server. Similarly, the frontend can be started by installing dependencies and running the development server. Once both servers are running, the React app communicates with the backend to display and manage todos.

Future improvements can include features such as user authentication, editing existing todos, adding due dates or categories, implementing filters, or adding dark mode. These enhancements would make the project even more complete and closer to real-world applications.

This MERN Todo Application is perfect for beginners learning full-stack development, as well as for showcasing practical MERN skills to recruiters and hiring managers.
